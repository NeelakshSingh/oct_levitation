roslaunch oct_levitation xyz_normal_control_com_wrench.launch sim:=false hardware_connected:=true description:="Linear dynamics of I40 Onyx with N52 discs tuned for input disturbance offset of 0.18mm for 100gms of force as a step disturbance and 60 deg PM at 28.1 rad (37ms delay tolerance). Assuming 24Hz ECB 3dB bandwidth. -20deg pitch rod experiments with igus bearings removed for more room in all DOFs. Rotational dynamics not tuned to any specific value, using 1.0 for both kp and Kd."
